    // Let us now have a look at how graphics is produced within TORTOISE
    // NOTE: The plotting part has been implemented rushly so it is not performant
    //       Feel free to suggest improvements
    
    // By including Plotter.hpp an external object plotter3d is defined.
    // It is built to have an interface and usage as similar as possible to std::cout.
    
    // The plotter3D object is nothing else than a frontend to GNUPlot, built to simplify the transfer of data from
    // TORTOISE objects to GNUPlot. The plotter3D object takes care of producing the appropriate input for GNUPlot
    
    // Before doing that there is one important this to do.
    // Since plotter3D needs to launch GNUPlot, it must interact with the operative system.
    // Programming in c++ in Linux/Mac and Windows have some important differences, especially when the c++ program has to
    // interact with the operative system.
    
    // Therefore you need to change some line in TORTOISE depending on your opertive system.
    // Before continuing with this tutorial,
    // go to Geometry/Plotter/Plotter.hpp   Line 90 and follow the instructions.
    // Then save that file.
    
    
    
    // ************************************************************
    // Plotter3d (Plotter.hpp)
    // ************************************************************
    
    // Before using the object the user should make sure that the object knows the path to GNUPlot
    // The user can assign it directly by assigning
    // plotter3d.gnuplotcommand = "/usr/local/bin/gnuplot > /dev/null 2>&1";
    // The above command works on my Mac.
    // First of all, you need to select the folder wehre your GNUPlot is
    // On Windows it might look something like
    // plotter3d.gnuplotcommand = "C:\\Users\\admin\\gnuplot\\bin\\gnuplot.exe";

    plotter3d.gnuplotcommand = "/usr/local/bin/gnuplot > /dev/null 2>&1";
    
    // It is however possible to directly modify this parameter in Includes/Configuration.hpp
    
    // To plot something, it is necessary to send it to the plotter3d object with the << operator

    // Plotting Lines >>> DEVELOPERS <<<

    // starts producing the input for GNUPlot
    plotter3d << exmplPointVector3D ;
    // Notice however that that does not trigger a plot. plotter3d will still be waiting for more instructions.
    // We will see later how to tell plotter3d to collect everything, send the data to GNUPlot and produce a plot.
    
    // ************************************************************
    // Labels >>> DEVELOPERS <<<
    // ************************************************************

    // Each graphical object that is send to plotter3d will automatically create an entry in the legend. If we do not explicitly

    plotter3d << LABEL("line 1");

    // Color >>> DEVELOPERS <<<
    // ************************************************************

    // If we do not specify the color of an entry, GNUPlot will decide it. We can assign a color with

    // Notice again that also this formatting flag refers to the last entered object. Or in other terms, we can pass formatting commands
    // after the related object.

    // Like this we are adding a second line to the plot.
    // plotter3d, noticing that a new graphical onbject is being passed, will finilise the GNUPlot input for the previous graphical object
    // and get ready for the new one.
    // Notice that the formatting flags do not apply to following objects. Here we need to specify them again.
    
    // Also notice how all the commands can be concatenated in a single line (similarly to std::cout)
