    // First of all, we realise that while photons have momentum, momentum at optical energies is so small that can be completely neglected.
    // What will really matter is the energy. From this point of view we will build a photon band that does not accurately describe the
    // momentum of the phonon, but describes well its energy.
    // We notice that the direction of the photon (not its polarisation) is quite irrelevant, given the very small size of the momentum.
    // Therefore we might as well describe only photons in any given direction. Furthermore we want to create a photon's band domain small
    // enough in k space to have negligible impact on the momentum conservation, but not too small to create problems with numerical precision
    // and rounding during plotting
    // For that reason we do not really use the realistic maximum momentum that a photon at the energies we are interested in will have (as it
    // might be so small to create problems with rounding at machine precision.
